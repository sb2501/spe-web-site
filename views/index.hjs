        <p style="position:absolute;top:50px;width:80%;right:10%;color:white;line-height:200%;">The chumash tribe inhabited mainly the southern coastal regions of California. The locations were from Santa Barbara and Ventura County and as far as Malibu. Scholars estimated that there were no more than 15,000 chumash indians. 
        
        The chumash were hunter-gatherers and gathered food through fishing. There were approximately 6 versions of chumash language that was spoken by the tribe. Spanish contact occurred on 1542 and this was with Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo who 
        
        had led two sailing vessels. Years after the establishment of missions and military presidios, the chumash people moved their villages into the Franciscan missions.  Mission San Buenaventura was built in 1782 and is still standing today 
        
        in Ventura, California. The mission was the last mission to be established in california. Another major establishment in Ventura County was the creation of Naval Base Ventura County located in the city of Port Hueneme. Prior to the construction 
        
        of the base there was a facility built there temporarily, this was during the beginning of WWII. In 1942 the base became official and began operating as Naval Construction Battalion Center, it had a major role during the Korean War as nearly all Navy 
        
        supplies were routed through the base. </p></div>

          <mark style="background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.5);color:white;font-size:15px;line-height:200%;">The base was originally meant to be a temporary wartime base for the Navy during World War II. 
          
          The land and coastline of Port Hueneme made it an ideal place for the construction of a wharf which could be used by large ships to load and discharge cargo. 
          
          After the creation of the wharf by Robert Bard in 1871, the port became the second largest port on the Pacific coast for grain shipments of barley, 
         
          wheat, and corn. When shipment increased, a light house was built to improve navigation and shone 40 miles out to sea. In order to accommodate 
          
          the growing traffic in the port, the wharf was extended from 900 feet to 1,500 feet, and it grew to 1,700 feet in 1912.

          An increase in construction of naval bases was brought about because of the attacks in the Pacific. 
          
          The port became an interest of Rear Adm. Ben Moreell. He enquiried the Bureau of Navigation to request the authority to 
          
          create a construction battalion. Moreell was seeking a place to build the advance base depot. One that would meet all his requirements, 
          
          which were to be located between rail and water, possess at least 2000 to 3000 linear footage of waterfront, and measure 
          
          approximately 350 acres of land. Moreell was searching for a site in the San Francisco Bay area, but he did not find any that 
         
          met these requirements. Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Harold R. Stark, suggested a site in Hueneme, California.
          
          On March 7, 1942, the port in Hueneme, California, was converted to an advance base depot.</mark></p></img>

          It was an old Indian-built irrigation system that was used to water 30 acres of gardens and orchards around the mission. Apart of the seven mile long system, a building called Valdez Alley off of Main Street, was later converted into a jail after 
          
          irrigation was no longer needed.

          The San Buenaventura Mission was founded in 1782, it was established by Father Junipero Serra. Today it is considered Ventura’s most popular attraction.</mark></p>
